## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Waterfall Methodology
Sequential Process: Development follows a linear sequence through distinct phases: requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
Rigid Structure: Each phase must be fully completed before moving on to the next, with limited opportunities for changes once a phase is finished.
Advantages: Clear documentation, easy to manage, predictable timelines.
Disadvantages: Inflexible, issues found late, long time before seeing the final product.

Agile:
Iterative & Flexible: Involves developing software in small, incremental cycles (sprints) that allow for frequent reassessment and adaptation.
Advantages: Adapts to change, delivers early and often, encourages collaboration.
Disadvantages: Less predictable, requires experienced teams, risk of scope creep.

Comparison Summary:
Waterfall is best suited for projects with clear, unchanging requirements and a need for strict documentation and linear progression.
Agile is ideal for projects where requirements may evolve, and frequent feedback and flexibility are crucial.
